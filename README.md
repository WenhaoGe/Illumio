# Hello Reviewer, how are you doing? 

## How I tested my solution

### The IDE I used is IntelliJ IDEA. I created a test folder and there is a test class inside of this test folder
### I wrote several test cases in this test class and I run these test cases to test my solution. If you want to run my solution, please git clone it first and then open it through IntelliJ IDEA, and then run it through the test class.

# Design Choice
### There are only two directions and two protocols, the total combination of them are four choices, so I created four HashMap for the four choices. One hashmap is called inTcp, one hashmap is called inUdp, one hashmap is called outTcp and the last hashmap is called outUdp. 

### if i have more time, I will not use HashMap to build the solution, instead, I will build the decision tree. 


## I like three teams. Data Team is my favorite one, and the second favirate team is platform team. And Policy team is the third favirate team.
